                    "Most smartphones nowadays natively support the scanning of QR codes which allows you to share anything, all without leaving your lock screen. Simply ask the person you would like to share your action with to open their camera app and point it at the QR code."

The button to toggle this option is located at the bottom-center of the screen (second from the left). If the QR code is still not showing after this, you likely have an older device that does not support live photos. An iPhone 6S/Plus or above is required." ]
